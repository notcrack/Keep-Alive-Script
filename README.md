# Keep-Alive-Script
A small powershell script that presses the F15 key every 30 seconds to keep a windows machine fully alive (and make Teams see you as active)

Sometimes when I'm working I need to do things away from my computer, but still at my desk. I have found that some people will avoid reaching out to me if they see my Teams status as "Away". 

My quick and dirty solution is a powershell (runs natively in the powershell app on windows) that clicks the F15 key (not a common key, so shouldn't interfere with any work) every 30 seconds.
